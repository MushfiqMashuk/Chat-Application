                                                       Technologies and Purpose
Basically I created this app for practicing my knowledge on Node.js. Key Technologies used in this app: 
1. Express JS (A node.js framework- allows us to write lesser code)
2. Socket.io (For live chat feature)
3. MongoDB database
4. Mongoose (A beautiful framework to use MongoDB, which allows us write database queries in our most beloved language- Javascript. Which is cool!)
5. EJS template engine
